Predicting Geolocation of Instagram Images - Nathaniel Flick, Brian Vincent, Nikhil Loney, Ajay Kulkarni

1. We have built a model to predict the location of an Instagram image based on its textual tags

2. We used K-Means clustering to divide the world into a set of discrete cells, each of which formed a class

3. Using these classes, we build a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the most likely class for a given input sample

4. We also developed a web page to visualize the results

5. Prediction accuracy ~65% (based on 5-fold cross validation)
